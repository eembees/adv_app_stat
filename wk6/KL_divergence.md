# KL divergence
KL metric is a premetric /  doesnt satifsy the triangle inequality

## Comparing distributions

When fitting variables, always extract cov matrices
Always get eigenvalues out, preferably plot the parameter rasterized space
- pearson cross correlation
- likelihood




### binning
if N draws are sorted into Nb bins, the KL divergence will be of order Nb / N

## thoughts
find more prob. distributions
consider a sabattical

## Exercices
